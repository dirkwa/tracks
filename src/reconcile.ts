/**
 * Combines positions from a history provider with the plugin's own store.
 *
 * The two sources record the same vessel differently. The plugin's store keeps
 * one position a minute forever, which is what a track from three years ago is
 * made of. A history provider keeps whatever resolution it was configured for
 * — often every couple of seconds — but only for as long as its retention
 * allows, and only for as long as it has actually been running.
 *
 * So neither is simply better. History is finer where it reaches; the store is
 * what remains everywhere else.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Trust history for any bucket where it returns a usable position. Use the
 * store for every other bucket.
 *
 * That one rule covers every way a provider's coverage can be incomplete,
 * without reading any configuration:
 *
 * - retention has dropped the old data — history returns nothing there
 * - the provider was installed after the boat started recording — likewise
 * - the provider was disabled, or its database was down, for a week — likewise
 * - the vessel was ashore and nothing was recorded — history returns nothing
 *   and so does the store, which is the correct answer
 *
 * Coverage is therefore discovered per query rather than configured, and
 * nothing breaks when it changes underneath.
 *
 * ## Why the sources cannot double up
 *
 * A history provider aggregates into resolution buckets and timestamps each
 * one on its boundary — 19:00:00.000, 19:01:00.000. The store keeps the actual
 * time a fix arrived, 19:00:01.212. The same physical position therefore has
 * two different timestamps, so joining on equality would silently keep both.
 *
 * Bucketing avoids the problem rather than solving it: each bucket is filled
 * from exactly one source, so no comparison between individual points is ever
 * needed.
